# PlasticScan

Project PlasticScan is an initiative that not only encourages individuals to make eco-conscious decisions but also rewards them for their efforts in protecting our planet. With the use of image processing, we make it easy for users to identify and categorize plastics they've collected, transforming a mundane task into a rewarding and educational experience. 

CNN model was used to classify the platics. 
model was built on one specific type of platic(HDPE).
This model was then tested using various kinds of plastic, accuracy was generated.

Javascript was used to build a webpage where images of platic can be uploaded.
these images can then be used as dataset for the already built model.
